main intro:


I'm working on implementing a new component for our DN404 project. Following our granular development approach:

Current focus: [component_name]
Purpose: [brief_description]
Test requirements:
- [key_test_1]
- [key_test_2]

Please help create the initial foundry boilerplate for:
1. The component demonstration contract
2. The component deployment script
3. The component test file

Starting with the most basic implementation that proves the core concept works.
