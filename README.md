# DN404 Liquidity Generator

A next-generation dual-nature token implementation combining NFT and ERC20 functionality with automated liquidity management, cross-token interactions, and innovative tokenomics.

## Overview

This project extends the DN404 standard (NFT + ERC20 dual-nature token) with advanced DeFi mechanics:

- ðŸ”„ Automated bonding curve for initial token distribution
- ðŸŒŠ Self-deploying liquidity pools (V2 & V3)
- ðŸ’« Cross-token liquidity generation for $CULT
- ðŸ”’ Non-extractable contract-owned liquidity
- ðŸ’° Smart transfer tax system
- ðŸŽ¯ Tiered whitelist system

## Core Mechanics

### Bonding Curve Presale (Days 1-12)
- Dynamic pricing mechanism starting at 0.025 ETH per 10M tokens
- Cubic price growth formula for fair distribution
- Daily tiered whitelist system
- Automatic LP deployment trigger after 12 days

### Tokenomics
- Maximum supply: 4.44B tokens
- 4% tax on LP buys/sells:
- 4% tax on bonding curve sells
  - 3% to owner of miladystation #598
  - 1% reflected back to LP fund
- Tax proceeds auto-convert to $CULT V3 liquidity

### Liquidity Management
- Automated V2 liquidity deployment post-presale
- Contract-owned, non-extractable V3 concentrated liquidity for $CULT pairing
- Contract-owned, non-extractable V2 liquidity
- Smart rebalancing system for optimal liquidity depth
- Fee collection system for owner of miladystation #598

### NFT Features
- 1 NFT per 1M tokens
- Default skip-NFT setting for gas optimization
- Manual NFT minting via balanceMint function

## Development

```shell
# Install dependencies
forge install

## Security

- All smart contract functions are internally tested
- Bonding curve calculations use fixed-point math library
- Reentrancy protection on critical functions
- Automated liquidity deployment safeguards
- [Audit information pending]
