# DN404 Liquidity Generator

A next-generation dual-nature token implementation combining NFT and ERC20 functionality with automated liquidity management and cross-token interactions.

## Overview

This project extends the DN404 standard (NFT + ERC20 dual-nature token) with advanced DeFi mechanics:

- ðŸ”„ Automated bonding curve for initial token distribution
- ðŸŒŠ Self-deploying liquidity pools
- ðŸ’« Cross-token liquidity generation for $CULT
- ðŸ”’ Non-extractable contract-owned liquidity
- ðŸ’° Smart transfer tax system

## Core Mechanics

### Bonding Curve Presale
- Dynamic pricing mechanism
- Automatic LP deployment trigger at threshold
- Fair distribution model

### Liquidity Management
- Auto-deployment of primary token LP
- Cross-token LP generation with $CULT
- Contract-owned, non-extractable liquidity
- Fee collection system for contract owner

### Technical Architecture
- Built on DN404 standard
- Foundry development framework
- Comprehensive testing suite
